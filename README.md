### Overview  
This project is an **interactive Chess game simulator** that allows users to play chess by clicking on pieces to see their valid moves and executing moves directly on the board. The game follows official chess rules, including castling, en passant, and pawn promotion. Additionally, it can read and execute moves from a file as an extra feature.
